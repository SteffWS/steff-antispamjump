This script aims to address the issue of players spamming the jump button in-game. Such behavior can 
be disruptive and detracts from the immersive experience of the server. To mitigate this, the 
script introduces a mechanism where players are automatically ragdolled when attempting to jump too frequently. 
Upon detecting a jump input, the player's character is forced into a ragdoll state, preventing them from 
continuously spamming the jump action.

How to:

- Download the steff-antispamjump script.
- Drag the script into your RedM server's resources folder.
- Ensure the script is started in your server.cfg.
